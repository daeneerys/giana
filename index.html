        <p>
          From the moment I knew you, my world became brighter, softer, and more
          beautiful. Every word you say feels like music, and you give me the
          comfort that feels like home. I never imagined someone could make my
          heart race this way, yet here you are, the reason behind every smile I
          wear.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know, I have my imperfections, but beneath all that, there's a heart
          that never stops caring for you. You’re the thought behind my calm and
          the warmth in every small thing I do. I have said things that hurt you
          not because I wanted to but because sometimes I can be dumb with the
          person I care about the most. I may not always get it right, but
          please know that your heart means everything to me. I can’t promise
          that I’ll never make mistakes, but I can promise that I’ll always
          care, always try, and always hold you close even when words fall
          short.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t think I’ll ever find the right words to describe how much I
          appreciate you. You’ve been my calm in the noise, my light in the
          dark, and my reason to keep trying even when things get hard. You’ve
          taught me what it means to be patient, to love without conditions, and
          to find peace in the little moments we share. I notice everything you
          do the way you care, the way you listen, the way you still choose to
          stay even when I’m not at my best. You make ordinary days feel special
          just by being in them. I hope you know how much you mean to me not
          just today, but in every small moment that I get to call you mine.
        </p>

        <p>
          No distance or silence could ever erase the warmth you've given me. I
          carry you in my heart through every sunrise and every quiet night,
          grateful for the love that continues to grow between us.
        </p>

        <p class="signature">
          Always yours,<br />
